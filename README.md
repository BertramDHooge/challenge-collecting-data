## Description
Like any other consumer market, the real estate market is constantly expanding, while realtors are on the race to finding ways to advance their businesses by aiming to predict the direction of the market in real time. In this regard, **ImmoEliza** will be best served by possessing *accurate, timely, and credible real estate data*. This is where extraction of web-based information from the property market becomes key, for this would allow real estate agents of **ImmoEliza** to collect and present data for analysis in a structured manner. 

To fulfil the requirements of the challenge, the team built a web scraper using Python. Our prepared workspace involved the use of an IDE/text editor,  plus the necessary libraries (ie Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas). 

**Walk through of this DIY scraping challenge:**
