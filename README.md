## Description
Like any other consumer market, the real estate market is constantly expanding, while realtors are on the race to finding ways to advance their businesses by aiming to predict the direction of the market in real time. In this regard, **ImmoEliza** will be best served by possessing *accurate, timely, and credible real estate data*. This is where extraction of web-based information from the property market becomes key, for this would allow real estate agents of **ImmoEliza** to collect and present data for analysis in a structured manner. 

To fulfill the requirements of the challenge, the team used web scraper. Our prepared workspace involved the use of an IDE/text editor,  plus the necessary libraries (ie Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas). 

**Walk through of this DIY scraping challenge:**
- Locating elements of the source code of the requisite URL from the **https://www.immoweb.be/en** web site.
- Extracting targeted elements (links) asynchronously per web get and saving these links by creating a list in a soup file for parsing 
- Creating a data frame using pandas for approximately 10,000 inputs 
- Saving everything in a CSV file
